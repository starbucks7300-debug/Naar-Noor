## 📦 Running locally

For full setup details, use [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Backend

```bash
cd api-server
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project src/NaarNoor.API/NaarNoor.API.csproj
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd naar-noor
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing and Git Hooks

### Post-Clone Setup

After cloning the repository, install hooks for your development environment:

```bash
cd naar-noor
npm run husky:install
```

This command sets up Git hooks that automatically run tests before each commit, preventing commits with failing tests.

### What Are These Hooks?

Git hooks are automated scripts that run at specific points in your Git workflow:

- **pre-commit**: Runs frontend tests before allowing a commit. Fails if tests don't pass.
- **post-merge**: Updates dependencies automatically if `package.json` changes during a pull/merge.
- **install**: Ensures dependencies are installed after fresh clones.

### How Pre-Commit Hooks Work

```bash
# You make changes and stage them
git add .

# You attempt to commit
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Pre-commit hook runs automatically
# If tests ✅ PASS → Commit succeeds
# If tests ❌ FAIL → Commit blocked, fix tests and retry
```

### Running Tests Manually

```bash
cd naar-noor
npm test      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ci  # Run tests once with coverage (CI mode)
```

### Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

If you absolutely must commit without running tests:

```bash
# Skip all hooks
git commit --no-verify

# Or set environment variable
HUSKY=0 git commit -m "emergency fix"
```

⚠️ **Use sparingly** — hooks exist to maintain code quality. Bypassing them defeats their purpose.

For hook-specific details, see [naar-noor/.husky/README.md](naar-noor/.husky/README.md).
